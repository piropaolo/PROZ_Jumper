# PROZ_Jumper

This game is currently being made by me as assigment for Java classes at Warsaw University of Technology.
It somehow resembles classic Icy Tower game. It is not finished yet, and I am doing my best to polish this game,
as best as I can. At the time of writing this, you can find and apk file with the current state of the application,
which is quite playable.
